Configuring Ejabberd

Configuring Ejabberd is a piece of cake.

Goto your Ejabberd configuration folder (mine is /opt/ejabberd-2.1.4/conf) - open “ejabberd.cfg”.

Find the line:

{auth_method, internal}.

Change to (comment out using “%%”):

%%{auth_method, internal}.

A few lines down, find the line:

%%{auth_method, external}.

Uncomment this line and the line beneath it.

Modify the line beneath to read something like (or wherever you put the auth script):

{extauth_program, “/opt/auth.php”}.

Restart your server to apply the configuration settings (after re-uploading your settings file).
